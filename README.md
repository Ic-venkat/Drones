# Drones
Web Application for predicting drones based on input data.<br>
Web application is developed using Flask <be>
This is a ML project where I trained 2 ML models using Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Algorithm<br>
This is a very basic project. Don't Judge me for this as I am a student when I am doing this project thank You :)

Run the model.py code first 
```cmd
# python model.py
```
This will train the models and save the Joblib files
