# Drones
Web Application for predicting drones based on input data.<br>
The web application is developed using Flask <be>
This is an ML project where I trained 2 ML models using a Support Vector Machine and a Random Forest Algorithm<br>
This is a very basic project. Don't Judge me for this as I am a student when I was doing this project Thank You :)

Run the model.py code first 
```cmd
python model.py
```
This will train the models and save the Joblib files
Then Run the app.py file using

```cmd
python app.py
```

This will start the web application in the local host

After starting the model you can input the model to predict drones which are based on random dataset values.
